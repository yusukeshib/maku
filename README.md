# maku (è†œ)

The command line utility (for now) accepts a GLSL shader text and an input image and an output effect-applied image that runs the shader on GPU. 
The command line run on your PC natively, and it's library is build for WASM too.
And you can run the GLSL testing web app on the demo website of this repo.

The initial goal:

- Very performant image filter command line tool on GPU
- Composable/Extensible filter structure with reusability(Group, Variable)
- Web UI to edit projects
- Machine learning filters ready

Before release:

- [ ] Instructions on how to build the tool
- [ ] An examples folder that uses it to convert an image.
- [ ] (eventually) make the readme page a marketing page.
